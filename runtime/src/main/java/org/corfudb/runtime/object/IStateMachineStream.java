/** An {@link Class} represents a stream (ordered, infinite sequence) of state machine operations.
 *
 *  <p> An instance of {@link Class} keeps a pointer within this infinite sequence. Consumers of
 *  a {@link Class} call {@link #sync(long, Object[])} to read updates from the stream, which moves
 *  the pointer (backwards or forward) to the position requested, returning a stream of state
 *  machine operations which should be applied to reach that position. These operations may
 *  contain undo/redo operations which must be applied to the object.
 *
 *  <p> A stream may have a parent stream, which means that stream is "based" of the parent
 *  stream. {@link #getParent()} and {@link #getRoot()} can be used to determine whether the
 *  stream has a parent stream, and what the root stream (parent without a child) of that hierarchy
 *  is. Child streams may contain a history of updates which differ from the parent stream's
 *  updates. In typical usage, these updates are "optimistic" updates. Calling
 *  {@link #sync(long, Object[])} with the special address
 *  {@link org.corfudb.runtime.view.Address.OPTIMISTIC} returns a stream of state machine updates so
 *  that the position of the stream matches that of its parent (effectively "undoing" all
 *  optimistic updates).

     * that a call to {@link #sync(long)} will return (in wall-clock time) all completed calls
     * to {@link #append(String, Object[], Object[], boolean)} before it.
     *
     * <p>{@link org.corfudb.runtime.view.Address.OPTIMISTIC} provides a stream of operations

     * updates.

     * state it was before {@link #sync(long, Object[])} was ever called.
     *
     * <p> After the completion of this call, the updates are considered consumed and the pointer
     * as reflected by {@link #pos()} will reflect the updates returned by this call.
